## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Personality-Driven Behavior

**Example: Aggressive vs Cooperative**

```python
# Aggressive (20% concession willingness)
- Starts at 105% of list price
- Makes 5% concessions
- Holds firm on floor
- Walks away if gap > 30%

# Cooperative (70% concession willingness)
- Starts at 100% of list price
- Makes 15% concessions
- Flexible on floor
- Splits difference to close
```

### 2. Learning from History

**After 10 negotiations with ACME Corp:**
```python
{
    "win_rate": 0.65,
    "avg_discount": 0.12,
    "avg_rounds": 3.5,
    "aggressiveness": 0.7,
    "price_sensitivity": 0.6,
    "relationship_value": 500000.0,
}

# Adjusts strategy:
# - Expects 3-4 rounds
# - Prepares for 12% discount
# - Recognizes aggressive behavior
# - Values relationship
```

### 3. Context-Aware Pricing

**End of Quarter + Low Pipeline:**
```python
context = VendorContext(
    quarter_position=0.9,  # 90% through quarter
    pipeline_strength=0.4,  # Weak pipeline
)

# Result:
urgency_multiplier = 0.75  # High urgency
concession_willingness += 0.3  # More flexible
floor_flexibility += 0.3  # Can go lower
```

### 4. Competitive Intelligence

**Against Salesforce (Premium Tier):**
```python
strategy = {
    "approach": "value",
    "price_adjustment": 0.95,  # 5% discount
    "emphasis": ["roi", "cost_effectiveness"],
    "talking_points": ["Comparable features at better value"],
}
```

### 5. Seasonal Adjustments

**December (Year-End Rush):**
```python
seasonal = {
    "demand_multiplier": 1.3,  # 30% higher demand
    "price_multiplier": 1.08,  # 8% premium
    "capacity_multiplier": 0.85,  # 15% constrained
}

# Result: Premium pricing justified by high demand
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

```python
from procur.agents.advanced_seller_agent import (
    AdvancedSellerAgent,
    AdvancedSellerConfig,
)
from procur.agents.seller_personality import VendorPersonality

config = AdvancedSellerConfig(
    personality=VendorPersonality.STRATEGIC,
    enable_learning=True,
    enable_constraints=True,
    enable_competitive_intelligence=True,
)

seller = AdvancedSellerAgent(
    vendor=vendor_profile,
    policy_engine=policy_engine,
    scoring_service=scoring_service,
    guardrail_service=guardrail_service,
    negotiation_engine=negotiation_engine,
    config=config,
)
```

### Generate Counter-Offer

```python
offer, strategy, alerts, policy, rationale = seller.respond(
    request=request,
    state=vendor_state,
    buyer_offer=buyer_offer,
    round_number=2,
    buyer_organization="acme-corp",
    competitive_intel=competitive_intel,
)

print(f"Strategy: {strategy.value}")
print(f"Price: ${offer.components.unit_price}")
print(f"Rationale: {rationale}")
```

### Record Outcome

```python
seller.record_negotiation_outcome(
    negotiation_id="neg-001",
    buyer_organization="acme-corp",
    category="CRM",
    initial_ask=150.0,
    final_price=140.0,
    rounds=4,
    outcome="won",
    duration_hours=48.0,
    buyer_aggressiveness=0.7,
)
```

## üìà Comparison

### Basic Seller Agent (69 lines)
```python
class SellerAgent:
    def respond(self, request, state, buyer_offer, round_number):
        # Single generic strategy
        strategy = self.negotiation_engine.determine_seller_strategy(...)
        counter = self.negotiation_engine.generate_seller_counter(...)
        # Return offer
```

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå No personality
- ‚ùå No learning
- ‚ùå No constraints
- ‚ùå No competitive intelligence
- ‚ùå Static behavior
- ‚ùå Single strategy

### Advanced Seller Agent (2000+ lines)
```python
class AdvancedSellerAgent:
    def respond(self, request, state, buyer_offer, round_number, ...):
        # Adjust personality for context
        adjusted_traits = adjust_traits_for_context(...)
        
        # Get buyer profile from learning
        buyer_profile = self.learning_system.get_buyer_profile(...)
        
        # Select sophisticated strategy
        strategy = self.strategy_engine.select_strategy(...)
        
        # Apply constraints
        offer = self._apply_constraints(...)
        
        # Apply competitive intelligence
        offer = self._apply_competitive_intelligence(...)
        
        # Return sophisticated counter-offer
```
