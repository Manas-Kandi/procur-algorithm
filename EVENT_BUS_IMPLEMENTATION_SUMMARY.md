# Procur Event Bus - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

A production-ready event bus system with Redis Streams, Celery workers, event sourcing, dead letter queues, and comprehensive monitoring for scalable async workflow processing.

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Event Bus Infrastructure

**Redis Streams Event Bus** (`src/procur/events/bus.py`):
- Persistent event storage with Redis Streams
- Consumer groups for load balancing
- Pub/Sub for real-time notifications
- Automatic acknowledgment and retry
- Dead letter queue for failed events
- Pending event tracking
- Stream info and metrics

**Event Configuration** (`src/procur/events/config.py`):
- Environment-based configuration
- Redis connection settings
- Stream and consumer group settings
- DLQ configuration
- Event sourcing settings
- Monitoring configuration

### 2. Event Schemas & Types

**Event Schemas** (`src/procur/events/schemas.py`):
- Base `Event` model with Pydantic validation
- 30+ event types across categories:
  - Request events (created, updated, approved, rejected)
  - Vendor events (created, enrichment started/completed/failed)
  - Negotiation events (started, round started/completed, offer received)
  - Contract events (created, generation started/completed, signed)
  - Notification events (email, Slack, webhook)
  - Integration events (ERP sync, DocuSign)
  - System events (error, warning)
- Event priority levels (low, normal, high, critical)
- Correlation and causation IDs for tracking
- Retry configuration per event

### 3. Event Sourcing

**Event Store** (`src/procur/events/store.py`):
- PostgreSQL persistence for audit trail
- `EventRecord` model with full event data
- Query by type, user, organization, correlation ID
- Track processing status and errors
- Automatic cleanup of old events (90 days default)
- Event replay capabilities

**Database Table:**
```sql
event_store:
  - event_id, event_type, timestamp
  - data, metadata (JSON)
  - user_id, organization_id
  - correlation_id, causation_id
  - priority, retry_count
  - processed, processed_at, error
```

### 4. Publisher & Consumer

**Event Publisher** (`src/procur/events/publisher.py`):
- Publish to Redis Streams and PostgreSQL
- Helper methods for common events
- Correlation ID tracking
- Priority assignment
- Automatic event store persistence

**Event Consumer** (`src/procur/events/consumer.py`):
- Consume events from Redis Streams
- Register event handlers
- Batch processing
- Automatic acknowledgment
- Retry logic with DLQ fallback
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

### 5. Celery Workers

**Celery Application** (`src/procur/workers/celery_app.py`):
- Redis as broker and result backend
- Task routing to specific queues
- Task priorities and retries
- Worker lifecycle hooks
- Beat scheduler for periodic tasks

**Worker Tasks** (`src/procur/workers/tasks.py`):
- `process_negotiation_round` - Process negotiation rounds
- `enrich_vendor_data` - Enrich vendor data from external sources
- `generate_contract` - Generate contract documents
- `send_notification` - Send notifications (email, Slack, webhook)
- `cleanup_old_events` - Periodic cleanup (daily)

**Worker Queues:**
- **negotiation** - 4 workers, high priority
- **enrichment** - 2 workers, normal priority
- **contracts** - 2 workers, high priority
- **notifications** - 4 workers, normal priority

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting

**Event Monitor** (`src/procur/events/monitoring.py`):
- Stream metrics (length, entries, groups)
- Consumer metrics (pending events, delivery times)
- Event type statistics
- Processing statistics (success rate, latency, throughput)
- DLQ statistics
- Health checks
- Comprehensive reporting

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Total events processed
- Success/failure rates
- Average processing time
- Pending events count
- DLQ size
- Event type distribution

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Publishing Events

```python
from procur.events import EventPublisher, EventType, EventPriority

publisher = EventPublisher()

# Publish with correlation ID for tracking
correlation_id = "corr-001"

publisher.publish_request_created(
    request_id="req-001",
    user_id=1,
    organization_id="acme-corp",
)

publisher.publish_negotiation_started(
    negotiation_id="neg-001",
    request_id="req-001",
    vendor_id="salesforce",
    user_id=1,
    correlation_id=correlation_id,
)

publisher.publish_contract_generation_started(
    contract_id="contract-001",
    request_id="req-001",
    vendor_id="salesforce",
    correlation_id=correlation_id,
)
```

### Celery Tasks

```python
from procur.workers.tasks import process_negotiation_round

# Async execution
result = process_negotiation_round.delay(
    negotiation_id="neg-001",
    round_number=1,
    correlation_id="corr-001",
)

# Wait for result
result.get(timeout=10)
```

### Monitoring

```python
from procur.events.monitoring import EventMonitor

monitor = EventMonitor()

# Health check
health = monitor.get_health_status()
print(f"Healthy: {health['healthy']}")

# Processing stats
stats = monitor.get_processing_stats(hours=24)
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']}%")
print(f"Avg processing time: {stats['avg_processing_time_seconds']}s")

# Event type distribution
type_stats = monitor.get_event_type_stats(hours=24)
```

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Code

The event bus integrates seamlessly with existing Procur components:

### Orchestration Pipeline
```python
from procur.events import EventPublisher

class SaaSProcurementPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.publisher = EventPublisher()
    
    def run(self, request):
        # Publish request created
        self.publisher.publish_request_created(
            request_id=request.id,
            user_id=request.user_id,
        )
        
        # Start negotiation (async via event)
        self.publisher.publish_negotiation_started(
            negotiation_id=neg_id,
            request_id=request.id,
            vendor_id=vendor.id,
            user_id=request.user_id,
        )
```

### Buyer Agent
```python
from procur.events import EventPublisher

class BuyerAgent:
    def negotiate(self, request, vendor):
        publisher = EventPublisher()
        
        # Publish round started
        publisher.publish_negotiation_round_started(
            negotiation_id=neg_id,
            round_number=round_num,
            correlation_id=correlation_id,
        )
        
        # Process negotiation...
```
