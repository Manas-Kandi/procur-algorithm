## Detailed Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Start the Application

**Backend:**
```bash
cd /Users/manaskandimalla/Desktop/Projects/procur-2
source venv/bin/activate
cd src
uvicorn procur.api.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
# New terminal
cd /Users/manaskandimalla/Desktop/Projects/procur-2/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Create a Procurement Request

1. **Login** at http://localhost:5173/login
   - Email: `buyer@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`

2. **Go to Dashboard** → Click "New Request"

3. **Fill out request details:**
   ```
   Description: "100 Slack licenses for engineering team"
   Request Type: saas
   Category: collaboration
   Quantity: 100
   Budget Min: $90,000
   Budget Max: $150,000
   Must Haves:
     - SSO
     - HIPAA compliance
     - API access
   Nice to Haves:
     - Slack Connect
     - Enterprise Grid
   ```

4. **Submit the request**

### Step 3: Launch AI Sourcing (Automatically Triggers Negotiations!)

1. **From the request detail page**, click "Launch AI Sourcing"
   - This calls: `POST /sourcing/start/{request_id}`
   - Creates negotiation sessions with top 5 vendors
   - **AUTOMATICALLY starts AI negotiations in parallel (NEW!)**
   - Sets request status to "negotiating"

2. **What happens behind the scenes:**
   ```
   GET /vendors (fetch active vendors)
   → Filter top 5 vendors
   → FOR each vendor:
       CREATE negotiation_session {
         session_id: "neg-abc123...",
         request_id: "req-xyz...",
         vendor_id: 123,
         status: "active",
         max_rounds: 8
       }
   → UPDATE request.status = "negotiating"
   → TRIGGER background task to auto-negotiate with ALL vendors (NEW!)
   → asyncio.gather() runs all 5 negotiations in parallel (NEW!)
   ```

### Step 4: Navigate to Negotiation Theater (Watch Live AI!)

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/negotiations/{requestId}`
2. You'll see the **NegotiationTheater** page with:
   - Top 3 vendors ranked by score
   - **Live negotiation feeds already streaming (automatic!)**
   - Connection status indicators showing "Connected"
   - Real-time events populating as AI negotiates

**No buttons to click!** Negotiations are already running in the background and streaming live updates.

### Step 5: Watch Real-Time AI Negotiation

**What you'll see in the live feeds:**

1. **Automatic WebSocket Connection**
   - Green "Connected" badge appears immediately
   - Frontend auto-connects to all active negotiation sessions
   - No manual setup required

2. **Live Negotiation Events Stream In:**
   - `negotiation_start` - AI begins negotiating with vendor
   - `negotiation_complete` - Final offer reached

   Each event shows:
   - Vendor name and session ID
   - Timestamp of event
   - Current status and progress

3. **Behind the Scenes (automatic):**
   ```
   Background task triggers: POST /negotiations/{session_id}/auto-negotiate
   → Backend creates BuyerAgent with full AI stack
   → Agent loads request and vendor from database
   → Runs negotiation rounds (up to 8):
       Round 1: Buyer anchors at $95/user (15% below list)
       Round 1: Seller counters at $108/user
       Round 2: Buyer uses term_trade strategy (24 months for discount)
       Round 2: Seller accepts with 5% multi-year discount
       ... continues until acceptance or max rounds
   → Saves final offer to database
   → Streams completion event to WebSocket
   ```

4. **Watch All Vendors Negotiate Simultaneously:**
   - Multiple live feeds update in parallel
   - Auto-scrolling keeps you at the latest event
   - See which vendor completes first

5. **When Each Negotiation Completes:**
   - Final offer displayed in the feed
   - Status changes to "completed"
   - Offer card updates with final details

### Step 6: Review and Approve

1. **See final offer details:**
   - Unit price negotiated
   - Total cost of ownership
   - Savings vs list price
   - Utility score

2. **Approve the offer:**
   - Click "Approve" to create contract
   - Or reject and try another vendor

## Current Architecture

### What's Working

✅ **Backend API:**
- `POST /sourcing/start/{request_id}` - Creates negotiation sessions
- `POST /negotiations/{session_id}/auto-negotiate` - Runs AI negotiation
- `WS /negotiations/ws/{session_id}` - WebSocket for real-time events
- Full buyer agent with negotiation engine
- Database persistence of offers

✅ **Frontend UI:**
- NegotiationTheaterLive page with live feed
- WebSocket connection management
- Real-time event display
- Auto-scrolling feed
- Connection status indicators

### What's NOW Fully Connected! ✅

✅ **Automatic triggering:**
- "Launch AI Sourcing" automatically starts AI negotiations with ALL vendors
- Negotiations run in parallel in the background
- No manual clicking required!

✅ **Live streaming during negotiation:**
- Real-time WebSocket connections automatically established
- Events stream as negotiations progress
- Live feed updates showing negotiation start, progress, and completion

✅ **Multi-vendor parallel:**
- All vendors are negotiated with simultaneously
- Background task queue handles parallel execution
- Live feeds update independently for each vendor

## How It Now Works (Fully Automatic!)

### Automatic Flow - Step by Step

**When you click "Launch AI Sourcing":**

1. **Backend Creates Sessions** (`POST /sourcing/start/{request_id}`)
   ```python
   # Creates negotiation sessions for top 5 vendors
   created_sessions = [session1, session2, session3, session4, session5]
   ```

2. **Auto-Triggers Negotiations** (Background Task)
   ```python
   # Automatically starts negotiations with ALL vendors in parallel
   background_tasks.add_task(
       _trigger_auto_negotiations,
       session_ids=[s1, s2, s3, s4, s5],
       user_id=current_user.id
   )
   ```

3. **Parallel Execution**
   ```python
   # All 5 negotiations run simultaneously
   asyncio.gather(
       negotiate(session1),  # Vendor 1: Slack
       negotiate(session2),  # Vendor 2: Microsoft Teams
       negotiate(session3),  # Vendor 3: Discord
       negotiate(session4),  # Vendor 4: Zoom
       negotiate(session5),  # Vendor 5: Google Chat
   )
   ```

4. **Real-Time Streaming**
   ```python
   # Each negotiation streams events via WebSocket
   await manager.send_event(session_id, "negotiation_start", {...})
   await manager.send_event(session_id, "round_complete", {...})
   await manager.send_event(session_id, "negotiation_complete", {...})
   ```

5. **Frontend Auto-Updates**
   ```typescript
   // WebSocket connections automatically established
   activeSessions.forEach(session => {
       useNegotiationStream(session.session_id)  // Auto-connects
   })

   // Live feeds populate in real-time
   <LiveNegotiationFeed events={streamHook.events} />
   ```

### What You See in the UI

1. **Click "Launch AI Sourcing"** → Immediate response with sessions created
2. **Navigate to Negotiation Theater** → See top 3 vendors
3. **Within seconds:** Live feeds start populating automatically
4. **Watch:** All vendors being negotiated with in parallel
5. **Results:** Final offers appear as negotiations complete

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No vendors showing"
**Fix:** Seed vendor data
```bash
cd src
python -c "from procur.db.seed_data import seed_vendors; seed_vendors()"
```

### "Negotiation sessions not created"
**Check:**
1. Request status is "draft", "intake", or "sourcing"
2. Vendors exist in database
3. User is authorized

### "Auto-negotiate button not working"
**Check:**
1. Session is in "active" status
2. Backend is running
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check backend logs for detailed error

### "WebSocket not connecting"
**Check:**
1. Backend WebSocket endpoint is accessible
2. URL should be: `ws://localhost:8000/negotiations/ws/{session_id}`
3. Auth token is valid
4. Browser console for WebSocket errors

---

## Example: Complete Flow with cURL

```bash
# 1. Login
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/auth/login' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"buyer@test.com","password":"password123"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

# 2. Create request
REQUEST=$(curl -s -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/requests' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "description": "100 Slack licenses",
    "request_type": "saas",
    "quantity": 100,
    "budget_max": 150000,
    "must_haves": ["SSO", "API"]
  }')

REQUEST_ID=$(echo $REQUEST | jq -r '.request_id')
echo "Created request: $REQUEST_ID"

# 3. Start sourcing (creates negotiation sessions)
SESSIONS=$(curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/sourcing/start/$REQUEST_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN")

echo "Created sessions:"
echo $SESSIONS | jq '.[] | {session_id, vendor_id, status}'

# 4. Get first session ID
SESSION_ID=$(echo $SESSIONS | jq -r '.[0].session_id')
echo "Negotiating with session: $SESSION_ID"

# 5. Trigger auto-negotiation
RESULT=$(curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/negotiations/$SESSION_ID/auto-negotiate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"max_rounds": 8}')

echo "Negotiation result:"
echo $RESULT | jq '.'

# 6. Check final offer
echo "Final offer:"
echo $RESULT | jq '.final_offer'
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Stream per-round events during negotiation:**
   - Currently: Events emit at start and completion of negotiation
   - Future: Emit events after each negotiation round
   - Benefit: See buyer/seller offers update in real-time, round by round

2. **Add progress indicators:**
   - Show "Round 3/8" counter during negotiation
   - Progress bar for negotiation completion
   - Estimated time remaining

3. **Add user controls:**
   - Pause/resume negotiation mid-flight
   - Adjust budget parameters during negotiation
   - Accept current best offer early (stop other negotiations)
   - Override AI strategy selection

4. **Enhanced visualization:**
   - Price chart showing offer/counteroffer history
   - Utility score graph across rounds
   - Side-by-side vendor comparison view
