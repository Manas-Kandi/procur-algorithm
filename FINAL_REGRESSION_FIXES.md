# Procur Platform - Final Regression Fixes

## üéØ Critical Blockers Resolved

All blocking issues preventing Celery workers from loading and integration tests from running have been fixed.

## ‚úÖ Round 3 Fixes (Critical Blockers)

### 1. **Fixed SellerAgent Instantiation** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: `tasks.py:128-131` instantiated `SellerAgent` with `llm_client` and `negotiation_engine` arguments, but the actual signature is `SellerAgent(vendor, policy_engine, scoring_service, guardrail_service, negotiation_engine, config=None)`. This caused `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'llm_client'`.

**Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of agent architecture. `SellerAgent` is instantiated internally by `BuyerAgent.negotiate()` with the correct parameters.

**Resolution**:
- Removed incorrect `SellerAgent` instantiation from task
- Added comment explaining that `SellerAgent` is created within `BuyerAgent.negotiate()`
- Task now only creates `BuyerAgent` and calls its `negotiate()` method

**Files Modified**:
- `src/procur/workers/tasks.py` (removed lines 128-131)

---

### 2. **Fixed Offer Score Access** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Code accessed `final_offer.score >= 0.7`, but `Offer.score` is an `OfferScore` object (not a float), causing `AttributeError`. When `final_offer` was `None`, the comparison crashed immediately.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect understanding of `Offer` model structure. The `score` field is an `OfferScore` object with fields: `spec_match`, `tco`, `risk`, `time`, `utility`.

**Resolution**:
- Changed to access `final_offer.score.utility >= 0.7`
- Added proper null checking with three decision states:
  - `"accepted"` - offer exists and utility >= 0.7
  - `"continue"` - offer exists but utility < 0.7
  - `"no_offer"` - no offer generated
- Added explanatory comment about `OfferScore` structure

**Files Modified**:
- `src/procur/workers/tasks.py` (lines 173-180)

---

### 3. **Fixed RequestType Enum** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Code referenced `RequestType.PHYSICAL_GOODS`, but the enum only has `SAAS` and `GOODS`, causing `AttributeError` before negotiation could start.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect enum value name.

**Resolution**:
- Changed `RequestType.PHYSICAL_GOODS` to `RequestType.GOODS`
- Matches actual enum definition in `src/procur/models/enums.py:4-6`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/procur/workers/tasks.py` (line 136)

---

### 4. **Verified JWT Token Fix** ‚úÖ
**Issue Reported**: Tests allegedly still used `sub=test_user.email`, but `get_current_user` expects integer user ID.

**Actual State**: The code was already correct from Round 2 fixes.
- Line 54 of `test_api_flows.py` correctly uses `{"sub": test_user.id}`
- No instances of `test_user.email` in token creation found

**Status**: Already fixed in Round 2, no changes needed.

**Files**: No modifications required

## üîç Key Architectural Learnings

### Agent Architecture
**Critical Understanding**:
- `BuyerAgent.negotiate()` orchestrates the full multi-round negotiation
- `SellerAgent` is instantiated **internally** by `BuyerAgent` with correct parameters
- Tasks should **not** create `SellerAgent` instances directly
- The buyer agent handles all seller interactions automatically

**Correct Pattern**:
```python
buyer_agent = BuyerAgent(...)  # Create with all services
offers_dict = buyer_agent.negotiate(request, vendors)  # Returns Dict[str, Offer]
```

**Incorrect Pattern** (causes TypeError):
```python
seller_agent = SellerAgent(llm_client=..., negotiation_engine=...)  # Wrong!
```

---

### Offer Model Structure
**Critical Understanding**:
- `Offer.score` is an `OfferScore` object, not a float
- `OfferScore` has multiple dimensions: `spec_match`, `tco`, `risk`, `time`, `utility`
- Use `offer.score.utility` for overall quality assessment
- Always check for `None` before accessing score fields

**Correct Pattern**:
```python
if final_offer and final_offer.score.utility >= 0.7:
    decision = "accepted"
elif final_offer:
    decision = "continue"
else:
    decision = "no_offer"
```

**Incorrect Pattern** (causes AttributeError):
```python
if final_offer.score >= 0.7:  # Wrong! score is an object, not float
```

---

### Enum Values
**Critical Understanding**:
- `RequestType` has only two values: `SAAS` and `GOODS`
- There is no `PHYSICAL_GOODS` enum value
- Always verify enum definitions before using them

**Correct Pattern**:
```python
request_type = RequestType.SAAS if type_str == "saas" else RequestType.GOODS
```

**Incorrect Pattern** (causes AttributeError):
```python
request_type = RequestType.PHYSICAL_GOODS  # Doesn't exist!
```

## üöÄ Verification Steps

### 1. Verify Celery Workers Load
```bash
# Should start without import errors
celery -A src.procur.workers.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

**Expected**: Workers start successfully, no `TypeError` or `AttributeError`

---

### 2. Verify Integration Tests
```bash
# Set up environment
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your-key"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/procur_test"

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_api_flows.py -v
```

**Expected**: Tests authenticate successfully, no `ValueError: invalid literal for int()`

---

### 3. Test Negotiation Task
```python
# Unit test for negotiation task
from src.procur.workers.tasks import process_negotiation_round

# Should not raise TypeError about llm_client
# Should not raise AttributeError about PHYSICAL_GOODS
# Should not crash on final_offer.score comparison
```

---

## üìù Files Modified (Round 3)

1. **src/procur/workers/tasks.py**
   - Line 128-131: Removed incorrect `SellerAgent` instantiation
   - Line 136: Changed `RequestType.PHYSICAL_GOODS` to `RequestType.GOODS`
   - Line 173-180: Fixed offer score access to use `score.utility`

2. **tests/integration/test_api_flows.py**
   - No changes needed (already correct from Round 2)

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] `SellerAgent` no longer instantiated with wrong arguments
- [x] `Offer.score.utility` accessed correctly with null checks
- [x] `RequestType.GOODS` used instead of non-existent `PHYSICAL_GOODS`
- [x] JWT tokens use integer user ID in `sub` claim
- [x] All imports present and correct
- [x] Context managers properly decorated
- [x] Repository methods available
- [x] LLM client handles missing API keys gracefully

---

## üéâ Status: Ready for Testing

The platform should now:
- ‚úÖ Load Celery workers without errors
- ‚úÖ Process negotiation rounds successfully
- ‚úÖ Pass integration tests with authentication
- ‚úÖ Handle domain model conversions correctly
- ‚úÖ Execute agent negotiations end-to-end

**Next Steps**:
1. Start Celery workers and verify no import/initialization errors
2. Run integration test suite and verify authentication works
3. Execute a test negotiation round and verify completion
4. Monitor logs for any remaining runtime issues

## üîÑ Round 4 Fix (Final Blocker)

### 5. **Fixed vendor.billing_cadence AttributeError** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: `tasks.py:160` accessed `vendor.billing_cadence`, but `VendorProfileRecord` ORM model doesn't have this column (see `src/procur/db/models.py:152-218`). This caused `AttributeError: 'VendorProfileRecord' object has no attribute 'billing_cadence'` at runtime.

**Root Cause**: ORM model and domain model field mismatch. The domain `VendorProfile` has an optional `billing_cadence` field, but the database schema doesn't include it.

**Resolution**:
- Changed `billing_cadence=vendor.billing_cadence` to `billing_cadence=None`
- Added comment explaining ORM model doesn't have this field
- Domain model accepts `None` as valid value (it's optional)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/procur/workers/tasks.py` (line 160)
